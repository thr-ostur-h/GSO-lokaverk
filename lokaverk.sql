I need a gun to keep myself among
The poor people are burning in the sun
But they ain't got a chance, they ain't got a chance
I need a gun cause all I do is dance
Cause all I do is dance

In my backpack, I got my act right
In case you act quite difficult
And your result weaken with anger and discontent
Some are seeking and in search of like Nimoy
I'm a peace-loving decoy, ready for retaliation
I change your whole location to a pine box six-under
Impulsive don't ask why or wonder
Orders given to me is:
Strike and I'm thunder with lightning-fast reflexes on constant alert
From the constant hurt that seems limitless with no drop in pressure
It seeming like everybody's out to take ya' 'til they see you break
You can't conceal the hate that consumes you
I'm the reason why you fill up your Isuzu
Chill with your old lady at the tilt, I got a 90 day extension
And I'm filled with guilt from things I done and seen
Your water's from a bottle, mine's from a canteen
At night I hear the shots
Ring so I'm a light sleeper
The cost of life, it seem to get cheaper
Out in the desert with my street sweeper
The war is over so said the speaker
With the flight suit on
Maybe to him I'm just a pawn
So he can advance
Remember when I used to dance
Dang, all I wanna do is dance

(Dance)
(Dance)
(Dance)
I need a gun
To keep myself from harm"),

Power on the motherboard, yes!
Push up, overload, legendary heavy glow
Sunshine, thunder roll, keep this on
Yes, the lantern burn, burn that easy
And broadcast, so raw and neatly
Thunder roll, sunshine, work it out

Overload, overload, overload
Comin' up to the
Overload, overload, overload

Oh stylo (juice)
Go forth, blossom in your soul
When you know your heart is light
Electric is the love
When the mako flies (a giant fish)
Up from the bottom in your eyes
Then I know the twilight skies
Are not so broken hearted
 
If this love is electric
It'll be flowing on the streets
Night after night..just to get through the week
Sometimes it's hard right now

Sing yourself (juice) out of depression, rise above
Always searching if I know your heart
Electric is the love..

There's only one way
Let it pray a little while longer
It's got a way of passing through man and woman
In another world, in another world and in the universe
Right now, here's what we got to do

If this love is electric
It'll be flowing on the streets
Night after night, just to get through the week
Sometimes it's hard
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout

Love, electricity, shockwave central
Power on the motherboard, yes!
Push up, overload, legendary heavy glow
Sunshine, thunder roll, keep this on
Yes, the lantern burn, burn that easy
And broadcast, so raw and neatly
Thunder roll, sunshine, work it out

Right now!"),
("On Melancholy Hill",4,"2010-06-14",NULL,1,1,1,1,"Up on melancholy hill
There's a plastic tree
Are you here with me?
Just looking out on the day of another dream

Well, you can't get what you want but you can get me
So let's set out to sea, love
'Cause you are my medicine
When you're close to me
When you're close to me

So call in the submarine
'Round the world we'll go
Does anybody know her?
If we're looking out on the day of another dream

If you can't get what you want then you come with me

Up on melancholy hill sits a manatee
Just looking out for the day
When you're close to me
When you're close to me

When you're close to me")
